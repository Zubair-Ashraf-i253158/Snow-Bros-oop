## 😇 About the Game

Snow Bros Remake is a faithful yet modernized reimagining of the beloved 1990 Toaplan arcade classic. Built entirely in **C++ with SFML**, this project demonstrates the power of **Object-Oriented Programming** through real-world game development.

What makes this remake special? **You play as Naruto Uzumaki** — throwing snowballs instead of kunai, encasing enemies in snow, and kicking them into chain-kill combos across 10 hand-crafted levels.

> *"We took a classic and made it ours,  same soul, new style."*

---

## 💜 Features

###  Gameplay
- **10 full levels** with increasing difficulty and unique enemy variants
- **2 Boss fights** — Mogera (Level 5) and Gamakichi (Level 10) with health bars and attack phases
- **Chain kill system** — kick encased enemies into others for combo kills and bonus drops
- **Bonus levels** (4 & 9) — collect all gems to advance
- **Snow encasement mechanic** — hit enemies twice to fully encase, then kick them

### 🎭 Characters & Customization
- **Play as Naruto Uzumaki** — custom sprite with jump animation
- **Multiplayer support** — Player 2 plays as a cyan-tinted Naruto variant
- **Power-up system** — collect star items for a 5-second speed boost (player turns yellow!)
- **Shop system** — spend gems on Extra Life, Speed Boost, Jump Boost, Snowball Power

### 👾 Enemies
| Enemy | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Bottom** | Ground walker, reverses at walls |
| **Flying Fooga** | Airborne, sine-wave flight pattern |
| **Tornado** | Throws knives at the player |
| **Invisible Enemy** | Appears only when near the player |
| **Mogera** | Boss — spawns babies every 2 seconds |
| **Gamakichi** | Final boss — fires rockets in 5 directions, 3 attack phases |

###  Level Design
- Levels 1–3: Classic enemy mix with increasing counts
- Level 5: **Boss — Mogera** (with baby spawns)
- Levels 6–8: Faster, tougher color variants (green → blue → purple)
- Level 4,9: Bonus level,  all gem collection
- Level 10: **Final Boss  Gamakichi** 

### 🎵 Audio
- **3 dynamic music tracks** that switch automatically:
  -  Menu music (splash, login, menus, shop)
  -  Level music (gameplay levels 1–4, 6–9)
  -  Boss music (levels 5 & 10)
- Music loops seamlessly and never restarts if already playing

###  Account System
- **Login / Signup** with persistent user authentication
- **Leaderboard** — real-time score tracking per user
- Scores saved and updated during gameplay

##  Technical Architecture

Built with full **OOP principles**:

```
Enemy (Abstract Base)
├── Botom          ← ground enemy + snow encasement states
├── FlyingFooga    ← flying AI
├── Tornado        ← knife-throwing enemy
├── InvisibleEnemy ← proximity reveal
├── Mogera         ← boss, spawns Mchild babies
│   └── Mchild     ← inherits Bottom
└── Gamakichi      ← final boss, multi-phase rockets
```

### Key OOP Concepts Used
- **Inheritance** — all enemies derive from `Enemy` base class
- **Polymorphism** — `hitByBall()`, `update()`, `draw()` are virtual; each enemy overrides them
- **Encapsulation** — each class manages its own state, textures, and health
- **Composition** — `Mogera` contains `Mchild babies[50]`; `Player` contains `SnowBall ball[10]`
- **Operator Overloading** — copy constructors properly handle SFML texture ownership

### State Machine (Enemy Snow System)
```
State 0 → Normal (walking)
State 1 → Half encased (still moves)
State 2 → Fully encased (frozen, kickable)
State 3 → Rolling (kicked, kills on contact)
State 4 → Melting (snow shrinks, enemy reappears)
```
